## BCHM 4354

This Github repo contains lesson files for **BCHM 4354 Biochemical
Communication**, a 4000-level course for Biochemistry and Life Sciences
students (Biochemistry Department, Virgina tech, Spring 2022). The goal
of the course is to introduce students to basic tools for data
processing, analysis, and visualization using the programming language
R.

### Notes:

-   This repo contains only materials relating to the course. Though
    statistics, multivariate analysis, and machine learning are
    discussed in many lessons, the focus is generally on the application
    and not on the theory.
-   Please note that some code does not work on purpose and without
    warning, to force students to learn to debug.
